# And this is the paragraph about something very important. Even math: $$ y_{sub}=\sqrt[]{(x_{sub})} $$
# 
#                                                                                                                       
#           
# Or python code example:
# 
#     import math
#     def foo():
#         return "foo"

# Here is the sample mean:  
#  $$ \overline{y} = \frac{1}{n}\, \sum_{i=1}^{n}\, y_{i} $$  
#  Here is the sample variance: 
#  $$ \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} - \bar{y})^2}{n-1} $$  
#  Here is the sample standart deviation: 
#  $$ \sigma = \sqrt[]{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} - \bar{y})^2}{n-1}} $$
